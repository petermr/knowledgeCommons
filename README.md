# semanticObelisk
A collection of existing semantic resources which can be linked to build a Global Semantic Knowledge Commons (GSKC).
"We" is an emerging community dedicated to this.

# rationale
Currently much information is "published" as monolithic documents. Scholarly publishing is irretrievably broken (cannot be mended), and the PublisherAcademicComplex has crippled the development of the Semantic Web in creating/distributing knowledge. GSKC (aka SemanticObelisk) is a bottom-up low-profile approach to redress this, in the same way as the [BlueObelisk.org](https://blueobelisk.org) in chemistry played an important part in promoting Open Data, Open Source software, and Open Standards. If we promote and coordinate our existing tools and resources we can build an impressive and useful Knowledge Commons . TODAY.

# Semantic Knowledge Commons
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons] describes a system where everyone has immediate and equitable access to the creation, dissemination, use and re-use of knowledge. "Semantic" means that machines can understand it and help humans to use it. Immediate benefits are increased discoverability, human- and machine-undersstanding of content, filtering, transformation, re-use, etc. As the Open Definition says "free to use, re-use and redistribute (without permission)".

## benefits of semantics
How often have you had to cycle through "click - download - edit - store - search" repeated hundreds of times? A semantic system can automate this - our `py/getpapers` can do hundreds of scientific articles a minute. Then search those containing plants and the chemicals they emit. Identify diagrams related to monsoons and extract the places mentioned? Don't understand acronyms like AFOLU? The machine looks these up automatically. Automatically extract clinical trials with over 1000 patients lasting forover a year? etc. etc. Semantics applies to every field - law, psychology, mathematics... all are possible in the Semantic Obelisk.
Or English is not your native language. How is "stubble" related to air pollution? A semantic framework can accommodate languages.

## creating semantic documents
Documents in HTML/XML are partially semantic; unfortunately the ubiquitous PDF destroys ALL semantics. We have to build up heuristically, but we've done much of the hard work. So it's possible to download hundreds of PDFs and add semantics to many types of documents.
